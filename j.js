        <p>
            My favourite healthy food is tomatoes. I love tomatoes because they have a high nutrient content like vitamin C and fibre, which makes them one of the best foods to eat if you want to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Tomatoes are also an excellent source of antioxidants that can help protect us from cancer and other diseases.
